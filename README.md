# Library assignment

## About
A pet project to demonstrate my understand of OOP concepts and best practices in C#. There are 3 entities: Book, CD, DVD and they are of type LibraryItem which implements ILoanable and IPrintable interfaces. These interfaces represent behaviors of all library items.

## What I learnt
C# has interesting features such as Properties that serve as a perfect
replacement for boilerplate getter and setter. Good project to review 
abstract class, interface, multiple inheritance and more.
